Make sure when wanting to checkout a new branch that you're in the right branch
- Ex: checkout development, then checkout -b "name", to make a new branch from that development branch

Deleting & Creating a new, updated development branch
1. Delete Development
2. git fetch -a = Gets a new development branch
3. git checkout development = Checks out the new development branch
