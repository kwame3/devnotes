1. Inject the router service
constructor(private formBuilder:FormBuilder,
              private myValidatorService:MyValidatorService,
              private router:Router){}

2. Create a method that would jump to the next page
public goToHomePage():void{
  this.router.navigate(["/"])
}

3. Add a click handler in your HTML
(click)="this.goToHomePage()"
Example: <a [routerLink]=[]  (click)="this.goToHomePage()" class="underline flex self-center">Save for Later</a>
