There are no spaces around the "=" in HTML
Radio buttons take up too much space
text-align:"" in HTML used to show where the element can be located in three positions vertically (left, center, right)
float:"" in HTML used to show where the element can be located in three positions horlsizontally (with center having no float, but "position:absolute; left: 0; right:0; margin:auto;")
Use *ngIf for removing or showing an entire page

div class = FOR TAILWIND -- which is a collection of CSS classes

SPAN IS FOR APPLYING CSS CLASSES
-  <span class="text-2xl">


<div class="p-2.5"> = Tailwind padding for 10px
 <div class="p-[15px]"> = Tailwind for 15 px (which cannot be written through the p-# format because there is no built in p-# for this number of 15)
 <div style="padding:10px"> = HTML padding for 10px


1. How to use <pre> ... </pre> to display values
		-- I use it a lot with the myForm

	2. validators
		Validators.required   (angular provides this)

	3. custom validators -- are own methods
		-- They are tricky
		-- Easy to screw them up
		-- lots of if statements with the custom validators


	4. The <mat-error>
		-- Creates a hard-coded error message whenver an error is on a control *AND* the control was touched


	5. How do we display all errors?
			this.myForm.markAllAsTouched()



	6. Got a refresher on breakpoints and step overs


	7. Console.log('hi mom')
		-- Used to display a message in the browser console
		-- Should be used sparingly
		-- Breakpoints are better

		-- I use console.log calls in my custom validators  (because breakpoints don't work well in custom validators)
		-- Everywhere else, I use breakpoints
