What did you learn?
 -------------------------
 1. Clicking to take you to another page

 2. Good refresher on custom validators
    + Very powerful
    - Very easy to screw up

 3. Generate a service

 4. Three mat-errors
    Created a myValidatorService
    We only needed th 1 <mat-error> tag
	-- 1 smart custom validator can easily replace 3 validators

 5. Code Completion
    + Sometimes Intellij helps
    - Sometimes, it makes things worse

 6. Regular Expressions
    Language for creating patterns

			[a-z]   matches one letter
            [a-z]+  matches 1 to zillion letters
            [a-z]*  matches 0 to zillion letters

              ^     means the beginning of the string
              $     means the end of the string

	+ Crazy powerful
    - Very easy to screw up

					/^[a-z][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]$/            pattern to match what the VALID strings are




 7. We can apply an array of validators

			this.formBuilder.group({

				contractNumber:  [null,  [Validator.required, Validator.minLength(7), Validator.maxLength(7) ] ],

			});

		Don't forget to use SQUARE BRACKETS when you have MULTIPLE validators



 8. Adam added the "nowrap" class to style.scss

		.nowrap {
		  white-space: nowrap;
		}


			<mat-error class="nowrap">
				This error will not wrap
			</mat-error>
