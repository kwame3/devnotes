1. Add a public method to an Angular service


2. This public method must return an Observable, with the method

public getStuff(): Observable<string> {

}

3. Create a local variable that is the same type of what's inside the returned observable type

let data: string = "Hi Mom";

4. Convert that data to an observable and return it

return of(data);


Final Example

public getStuff(): Observable<string> {

    let data: string = "Hi Mom";
    return of(data);

}
