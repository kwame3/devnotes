Kubernates is used for building containers, that can be independent of one another
- A container is like a huge zip file that your image is on
- the image of the container is transferable
- an advantage of Kubernates is more containers can be used at a time
- Kubernates is like a layer on top of all your servers
- allows for better success of deployments
- Kubernates is the same for AWS, Azure, etc.
- Great Benefits of Kubernates are abstraction and building containers

- Containers start fast & are easy to deploy
- Containers are lightweight and contain all your dependencies
